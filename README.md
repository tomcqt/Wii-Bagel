# Description
jornmann: "Wii Donut is just a spinning donut for your Wii!
All the hard work was done by Andy Sloane (coding) and Jogeir Liljedahl (the sweet music), I just threw it on a Wii."

Gabubu: "I asked them for permission and they agreed, so I can upload them here as a backup!"

`The background song is Addiction by Jogeir Liljedahl.`
